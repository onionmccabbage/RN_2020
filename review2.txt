========
Use https://swapi.dev/api to build a 'Star Wars' application
Provide a 'category' drop-down list with options for 'people', 'planets', 'species' or 'starships'
e.g.
<select id='category'>
    <option value='people'>People</option>
    <option value='planets'>Planets</option>
    <option value='species'>Species</option>
    <option value='starships'>Starships</option>
</select>

Also provide a numeric input between 1 and 3
	e.g. <input type="number" min="1" max="3" required/>
Provide a button which when clicked makes a 'fetch' call to 
	`https://swapi.dev/api/${category}/${num}/` 

Populate a model when the data is returned
For every request, show the returned 'name' property

NOTE: several requests are broken, such as https://swapi.dev/api/vehicles/2
You should catch these errors and handle them gracefully

Optional
========
Architect the app in modules, including a separate module for the 'fetch' service
Conditionally show other returned data members. 
So for people you could show 'eye color' and 'height'
   for planets you could show 'population'

Super Optional
==============
For most result sets, there is a collection of films. Make a further request to get information about the first film in any result set and show a few of the film data members in the page.
