Review Exercise 4
=================
Build an app where the user can choose a category and a number then retrieve data from either typicode or swapi (as in previous exercises using fetch)
Show a few retrieved data members in a separate view. Include navigation back to the first page

Provide navigation via buttons or via touchables

Optional
Every time a query is made, add the query terms to a collection (e.g. an array)
Provide another view which lists the queries that have been made. Clicking should make a fresh query with those historical parameters

Aim for separate components, which you import into App.js
Implement Redux throughout your app
