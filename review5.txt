Review Exercise 5
=================
Build a weather app: the user enters a city and a country to retrieve a weather report
When the user enters a valid city and country (2-3 letter code) call a service
In the service, invoke openweathermap.org like this:

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=hull,gb&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1

Replace hull,uk with city and country entered by the user

Familiarize yourself with the returned weather JSON
Use the loaded data to populate an instance of a Weather class
  e.g.  myWeatherClassInstance.weatherDescription = this.weatherReport.weather[0].description

Remember to convert temperature to Celcius by subtracting 273 (e.g. write a utility function)

Optional
--------
Use //@flow to implement type-safe coding. Also try using propTypes (remember to import)
Use a lifecycle event to make a weather call when the app homepage first loads, using default city/country values
Add each weather report to an array of weather reports, along with a time-stamp
Show the array of weather reports in a FlatList within separate component
Implement routing to navigate between the weather form and the historical weather reports
Clicking a historical report should enter the city and country back into the fields
