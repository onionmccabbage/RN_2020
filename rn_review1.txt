React Native Review Exercise 1 see https://pastebin.com/rpLtf9as
==============================
Create a new React Native app and explore layout, flex dimensions and flexbox as discussed in the tutorial:
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/height-and-width
(skip the fixed dimensions bit)

You should be able to copy the sample code from the website and implement it in your App.js file

As well as the code shown in the tutorial, try layouts of your own. 
For example, try to create flex layouts with:
- two equal sized Views and one View filling the remainder of the screen
- a small View along the top and a small View along the bottom, with two Views filling the remainder of the screen

Use Flexbox to create a simple layout that fills the whole screen, with a top, middle and bottom, where the middle is split three across (or any other layout you like)

Implement a simple FlatList as per the tutorial website
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-a-listview

Optional
--------
Declare another custom components containing some text and an image. Pass a 'title' property into your text/image component and display in the view along with the other components
Implement navigation between the component views
