React Native Review Exercise 2 see https://pastebin.com/TnCRzdSi
============================== 
Begin a new React Native app and import react-navigation into it (plus other dependencies)
Provide a screen where the user can enter 'city' and 'country' values
Also provide a button on the same screen
Touching the button should invoke a service which makes a call to OpenWeatherMap (using fetch)

  `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city},${country}&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1`

When the JSON is returned, populate a data model with properties such as the weather description and temperature
	e.g. description = returnedJson.weather[0].description
Show the description and temperature on the screen

You need to decide which data should be passed as props and/or state
Aim for a modular architecture where classes are in separate files, using export and import statements

Apply some style to your component via stylesheet.create()

If time, create a second screen to show the description and temperature.
In the event that weather data is obtained, automatically navigate to this new screen, and provide a navigation route back to the first screen

Optional
--------
Show the wind speed and direction (and other weather info as you see fit)
For each request, append the weather results to an array. 
Show this historical array as a flatlist in a new view if the user chooses to navigate to it. 
Touching a data member in this view should navigate back to the first view, and should put the city and country values into the fields. 
Thus the user can easily make a fresh call for the latest weather
See if you can implement Redux to manage this app
